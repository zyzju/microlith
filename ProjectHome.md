**microlith** (_as defined in dictionary_): a small stone tool that is sufficiently worked so as to be distinguishable from workshop waste or accidents.

**microlith** (_this simulation package_): a small simulation tool that is sufficiently accurate so as to allow investigation of image formation in microscopy and lithography systems.


This MATLAB package provides accurate algorithms for simulation of images produced by coherent, incoherent (fluorescence), and partially coherent microscopy methods. Arial images projected by optical lithography systems can also be simulated.
If you are new to image simulation or partially coherent image simulation, please start by reading  [this tutorial and user guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-mA2Q2RdhdoZFNwcW85MHJzdGc).

**The current source code and testbenches (that illustrate how to use microlith) can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-mA2Q2RdhdoRDVzd2R5a1hxdFU&usp=sharing).**

An in-depth discussion of accuracy of microlith and some intriguing results about dark-field microscopy can be found in our paper:
Shalin B. Mehta and Rudolf Oldenbourg, “Image simulation for biological microscopy: microlith,” [Biomedical Optics Express, Vol. 5, Issue 6, pp. 1822-1838 (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/BOE.5.001822).
